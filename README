Usage:

There are currently two supported modes: Custom, and Weever App.

In custom mode, use the plugin settings to specify which mdetect detection methods you wish to test for: for example, if you want to specify that iOS devices will be forwarded to an app in the App Store, you would specify "DetectIos" (without the quotes) in the Device Detection Functions field, and the itunes:// address to the app in the Forwarding URL. 

In Weever App mode, the Weever App component for Joomla will manage your redirection settings. If you are doing this, it is better to install the full Weever extension package, available for download at <http://weeverapps.com/downloads>.

If you want to turn off device detection for your specific device or for visitors who wish to view your regular Joomla site layout, pass the variable full=1 in your URL query string, IE <http://yoursite.com/index.php?full=1>. This will disable detection for the duration of the browser's session. To undo this, pass full=0.
